# Dataform

Dataform is a powerful, lightweight, and flexible form builder library for React applications, designed to make it easy to create and manage complex forms with minimal code while maintaining excellent performance and aesthetics.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind Dataform is to simplify form creation and management in React applications. We aim to provide a highly customizable and easy-to-use solution that can handle complex form structures, dynamic rendering, and validation with minimal effort from developers, all while being lightweight and performance-oriented.

## Features

- Intuitive form configuration using JSON schema
- Support for various input types and controls
- Conditional rendering based on form data
- Built-in form validation
- Customizable layouts and theming
- Support for array and nested objects
- Extensibility through custom input components and layouts
- Performance: Only updates what has changed, ensuring efficient rendering
- Lightweight design with a focus on aesthetics

## Installation

To install Dataform, run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm install dataform-react

or

yarn add dataform-react

## Usage
To use Dataform in your React application, simply import the main Dataform component and pass the JSON schema and initial form data as props:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Dataform from 'dataform-react';

const schema = {
  // Your JSON schema goes here
};

const initialData = {
  // Your initial form data goes here
};

const MyForm = () => {
  return <Dataform schema={schema} initialData={initialData} />;
};

export default MyForm;

## Roadmap

Our future goals and enhancements for Dataform include:

1. Support for additional layout types (e.g., grid layout, datatable)
2. Integration with popular form libraries (e.g., Formik, react-hook-form)
3. Improved performance and optimization techniques
4. Comprehensive documentation and examples
5. A set of pre-built themes for easy customization
6. Extending support for validation libraries
